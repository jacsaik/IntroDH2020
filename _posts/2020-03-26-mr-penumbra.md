- Connected deeply with class topics
- Shambavi loved the book
- Clay starts working at bookstore no one goes in except repeat customers and he has to write down all their information and he’s not allowed to open the books but the customers are using the books are trying to figure out the mystery of immortality and clay tries to solve it digital instead of analog he gets help from girl who works at google to scan books to figure out the mystery of how to live forever
- Written in 2010-2011 which is largely before most of what we have written
- Represented a different era of how people thought about google/google books
- What is author trying to say about google books?
    - Approving of google books project and process of digitizing
    - Answer was he head to go through a physical copy to find the connection
    - Loss that takes place in book scanning plays a significant role in the story
- What did he get wrong?
    - Inaccurate representation of book scanning
    - Description of book scanning machine is an amazing and accurate machine when it was really some underpaid hourly worker in a back room
    - Lots about invisible labor
- Girl at google trying to get onto “leadership board” is utopian 
- Tried to critique google and google’s power through Cat’s(?) character
- Embracing of the idea of piracy
- Scene where he needs to get the font so he just pirates it himself and he won’t pay ridiculous amount to have access to it
- What do you think the author’s angle was?
    - Meals with specific optimized food
    - Clay thinks it’s amazing but it’s actually terrifying
    - Clay is into google but sloan is not and uses clay’s character/excitement to show the dark side of google
    - San Francisco described as utopian
    - Sloan talks a lot about physical aspects of design probably has some kind of background in that i.e. font type, portals, meals
- Watch YouTube video
- Book outlines imaginative textual possibilities of DH
- How to integrate book into final project
    - More about Sloan than book
    - Bring physicality back into google books
